          <h2>What Is A Food Desert?</h2>

          <p> The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines a food desert as mostly being about proximity to food providers. Food deserts can be described as geographic areas where residents’ access to affordable, healthy food options (especially fresh fruits and vegetables) is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient travelling distance. The other defining characteristic of food deserts is socio-economic: that is, they are most commonly found in black and brown communities and low-income areas (where many people don’t have cars). </p>

          <p>There are many ways to measure food store access for individuals and for neighborhoods, and many ways to define which areas are food deserts—neighborhoods that lack healthy food sources.</p>
          <p>Most measures and definitions take into account at least some of the following indicators of access:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Accessibility to sources of healthy food, as measured by distance to a store or by the number of stores in an area.</li>
              <li>Individual-level resources that may affect accessibility, such as family income or vehicle availability.</li>
              <li>Neighborhood-level indicators of resources, such as the average income of the neighborhood and the availability of public transportation.</li>
          </ul>
