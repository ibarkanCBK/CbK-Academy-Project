          <h2>Key Facts</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Limited access to supermarkets, supercenters, grocery stores, or other sources of healthy and affordable food may make it harder for some Americans to eat a healthy diet.</li>
              <li>The USDA defines food deserts as “parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.” </li>
              <li>In Philadelphia, grocery stores are never located in the lowest income areas ($0-12,000), and much of the southwest and southeast low to medium income areas of the city have no grocery stores at all.</li>
              <li>Overall, a correlation between the socio-economic status and the location of grocery stores can be seen. The majority of grocery stores tend to cluster around higher income and lower unemployment areas. This correlation gives rise to the food deserts present in mainly the south, west, and northeastern part of Philadelphia. </li>
              <li>People who live in these areas have a higher risk of suffering from statistically higher rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other diet-related conditions than the general population.</li>
